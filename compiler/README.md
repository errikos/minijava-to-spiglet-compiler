# MiniJava Compiler

Developed in the context of the 2015 Compilers course, taught in the
Department of Informatics and Telecommunications in University of Athens.

The project package tree looks like this:

```
- minijava
  - parser
  - syntaxtree
  - visitor
  - semantic_check
    - structures
    - visitors
  - spiglet_generation
    - structures
    - visitors
```

The `minijava.parser`, `minijava.syntaxtree` and `minijava.visitor` packages
contain code generated from the JTB and JavaCC tools.

The `minijava.semantic_check` package contains code that performs semantic
check on the input.

The `minijava.spiglet_generation` package contains code that produces the
Spiglet output.

You will also find a directory named `examples`, which contains the example
files on which the program was tested, along with a script that executes the
examples and for each of them compares the output produced with the output
expected.

Finally, for your convenience, an `ant` `build.xml` has been included, as
generated by IntelliJ IDEA. If you need to use it, don't forget to set the
appropriate values for your system in the `build.properties` file.
